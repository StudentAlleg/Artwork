Happy 25th birthday Microsotf/Free Allegiance!

In here you have files in case your game crashes because of my special map!

If you're having trouble with the 25th anniversary game special map, copy everything from this /SafeMode folder to the games' /ARTWORK folder.

(First do try running the game at 1024 texture size or lower, might solve your issue)

Copying these files to /ARTWORK will overwrite the special art with a dummy file that is very low res and all black, very sad.


If you wish to REVERT from safe mode to the big pretty files, copy everything from /REVERT_SafeMode to /ARTWORK.

YMMV

If you got issues, just ask me, Spinoza, I'm the annoying one, can't miss me.
